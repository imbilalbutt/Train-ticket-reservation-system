## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a train reservation system backend exposing secure, RESTful endpoints for managing trains, reservations, users, authentication, and authorization. It demonstrates real-world enterprise techniques, including:

* **Spring Boot** for streamlined application setup
* **Spring MVC** for REST controller routing
* **Spring Security** for role-based access control (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`)
* **Dependency Injection** using Spring IoC
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** for cross-cutting concerns like logging and audit
* **Functional Programming** with `Function<Model, DTO>` converters for clean Model ‚ÜîÔ∏è DTO transformation
* Solid architecture: Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories
*  Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized containerization
* Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Jetty server deployment (extensible to WildFly, GlassFish, etc.)
* Spring Security with role-based access control
* Comprehensive API documentation

---

---

## üì• Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17+ installed

* PostGres SQL

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imbilalbutt/spring-reservation-system.git
   cd spring-reservation-system
   git checkout cleaned-v1.2
   ```

2. Configure application settings in `application.properties` (or `application.yml`), including:

   * Database connection (default: PostgreSQL)
   * Spring Security credentials
   * Customizable server port

3. Build and run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The project includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for optimized container builds:

### Dockerfile Structure

```dockerfile
# STAGE 1: Build stage with Maven
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS build_project
ENV POSTGRES_DB=lhr_rsv \
    POSTGRES_USER=imbilalbutt \
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password@123
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

# STAGE 2: Runtime stage
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS run_application
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build_project /app/target/reservation-system.jar .
COPY --from=build_project /app/src/main/resources/ ./resources/
EXPOSE 4000
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/reservation-system.jar"]
```

Key Features:
* Multi-stage build reduces final image size

* Dependency caching for faster rebuilds

* Environment variables for database configuration

* Port 4000 exposed for the application

Build & Run Commands:
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t reservation-system:v1 .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:4000 --name reservation-system reservation-system:v1
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a Jenkinsfile for automated builds and deployments:

Pipeline Features:
* Multi-stage workflow: Checkout ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy

* Environment variables for consistent configuration

* Jetty server deployment (can be extended to WildFly/GlassFish)

* PostgreSQL integration with credentials management

* Artifact archiving for build outputs

Deployment Options:
```groovy
environment {
    DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 'jetty'  // Can be 'jetty', 'wildfly', or other servers
    JETTY_HOME = '/path/to/jetty'
    SERVER_PORT = '9090'
}
```

Server Support:
Primary: Jetty 12.0+ (lightweight and fast)

Extensible: Can be configured for WildFly, GlassFish, or Tomcat

--- 

## üö¢ Deployment Options
### 1. Jetty Server (Default)
```bash
# Using included Dockerfile
docker build -t reservation-system .
docker run -p 8080:4000 reservation-system
```

### 2. Extending to Other Servers
   
Modify the DEPLOYMENT_TARGET in Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
environment {
    DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 'wildfly'  // Change to desired server
    WILDFLY_HOME = '/path/to/wildfly'
}
``` 
Supported server options:

* Jetty (default)

* WildFly

* GlassFish

* Tomcat (requires WAR packaging)


---

## üõ° Cross-Cutting & Security

* **AOP Logging** ‚Äî Logs execution times of service methods
* **Security Config** ‚Äî Roles, password encoder
* **Exception Aspect** ‚Äî Handles and formats exceptions consistently

---

## üîÑ Model ‚ÜîÔ∏è DTO Conversion

Leverages Java Functional interfaces for clean mapping:

```java
Function<Train, TrainDto> trainToDto = train -> new TrainDto(...);
Function<TrainDto, Train> dtoToTrain = dto -> new Train(...);
```

This approach enhances readability and testability by decoupling conversion logic from controllers and services.

---

## üß™ Testing

* Unit tests: JUnit + Mockito for services, controllers, and AOP aspects
* Integration tests: Load full context, mock security, validate end-to-end behavior

To run tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```
